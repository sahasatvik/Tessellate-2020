# A fractal canopy

![Fractal tree](tree.png)

This is a [fractal canopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_canopy).
The pattern is generated as a tree, in which each branch splits into two at a fixed angle.
The ratio of the length of the new branch and the old one is also fixed.

By tweaking the branching angle, we can generate patterns such as the [H-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_tree).
Here, the new and old branches are perpendicular, and are scaled down by a factor of 1/âˆš2.
